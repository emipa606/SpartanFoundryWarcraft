--- Original Description ---
Makes all marine armors by Spartan Foundry craftable:

List of Warcraft

- Powered Assault Armor + Powered Assault Armor Helmet *present
- Engineer Power Armor + Engineer Power Armor Helmet
- Explorer Power Armor + Explorer Power Armor Helmet
- Grenadier Power Armor + Grenadier Power Armor Helmet
- Commando Armor + Commando Armor Helmet
- Hazard Operations Armor + Hazard Operations Armor Helmet
- Diplomat Power Armor + Diplomat Power Armor Helmet
- Defender Power Armor + Defender Power Armor Helmet
- Scout Power Armor + Scout Power Armor Helmet
- Samurai Power Armor + Samurai Power Armor Helmet
- Shock Trooper Armor + Shock Trooper Armor Helmet
- Recon Power Armor + Recon Power Armor Helmet

All Power armors and helmets are available at the Fabrication Bench now after Research. A Power Cell (when installed) or an AI Persona Core is needed in some cases, to balance out the access to this superior warcraft.

Requirements

- Fabrication Bench ("Advanced Fabrication")
- Research ("Mechanoid Portable Energy")
- Crafting Skill 12

Load Order

1. RimWorld: Spartan Foundry (needed)
2. Available Translations
3. Spartan Foundry Warcraft (patch)



4. More Crashed Ship Parts (optional: 2,4,5,6)
5. Mechanoid Power Source (Auto balance, when found)
6. Mechanoid Master Blaster (swap this three in front, for harder research and MPC crafting costs)

Covers the private parts of your colonists in an appropriate way!

Notes
Small interactive patch to make all the gear craftable. Can be combined with any of the listed mods.
