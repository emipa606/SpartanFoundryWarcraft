# List of Warcraft


 - Powered Assault Armor + Powered Assault Armor Helmet *present
 - Engineer Power Armor + Engineer Power Armor Helmet
 - Explorer Power Armor + Explorer Power Armor Helmet

All Power armors and helmets are available at the Fabrication Bench now after Research. A Power Cell (when installed) or an AI Persona Core is needed in some cases, to balance out the access to this superior warcraft.

# Requirements


- Fabrication Bench (&quot;Advanced Fabrication&quot;)
- Research (&quot;Mechanoid Portable Energy&quot;)
- Crafting Skill 12

# Load Order


1. RimWorld: Spartan Foundry (needed)
2. Available Translations
3. Spartan Foundry Warcraft (patch)

4. More Crashed Ship Parts (optional: 2,4,5,6)
5. Mechanoid Power Source (Auto balance, when found)
6. Mechanoid Master Blaster (swap this three in front, for harder research and MPC crafting costs)

*Covers the private parts of your colonists in an appropriate way!*

**Notes**
Small interactive patch to make all the gear craftable. Can be combined with any of the listed mods.
